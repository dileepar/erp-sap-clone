# SAP.Core.Domain

## 📋 **Purpose**
This project contains the core domain models, entities, and business rules for the SAP Clone ERP system.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**
Following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Clean Architecture patterns.

## 📦 **What Goes Here**
- **Entities**: Core business objects
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects with business meaning
- **Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries for related entities
- **Domain Events**: Business events that occur in the domain
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't fit in entities

## 🎯 **ERP Modules**
When implemented, this will contain:
- Financial Management entities (Account, Transaction, JournalEntry)
- Human Resources entities (Employee, Payroll, TimeEntry)
- Supply Chain entities (Product, Order, Inventory)
- Customer Management entities (Customer, Invoice, Payment)

## 🔗 **Dependencies**
- No external dependencies (pure domain logic)
- Only references .NET 9 base class library
