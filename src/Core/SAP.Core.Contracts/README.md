# SAP.Core.Contracts

## 📋 **Purpose**
This project contains the interfaces, DTOs, and contracts that define the boundaries between layers in the SAP Clone ERP system.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**
Defines contracts for Clean Architecture boundaries and dependency inversion.

## 📦 **What Goes Here**
- **Repository Interfaces**: Data access contracts
- **Service Interfaces**: External service contracts
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for API responses
- **Commands**: Request objects for write operations
- **Queries**: Request objects for read operations
- **Response Models**: Standardized API response formats

## 🔗 **Interface Segregation**
Following SOLID principles with focused, minimal interfaces:
- Read/Write separation for CQRS
- Role-based interfaces for different concerns
- Clear boundaries between layers

## 🎯 **ERP Contracts**
When implemented, this will contain:
- Financial reporting interfaces
- Employee management contracts
- Order processing DTOs
- Customer service interfaces

## 🔗 **Dependencies**
- Minimal dependencies (data annotations, validation)
- No business logic or external dependencies
- Shared across all other projects
